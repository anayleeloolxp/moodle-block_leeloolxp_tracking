# Leeloo LXP Attendance
Boost engagement with the time tracking front end block!
# Description
This block allows administrators and authorized personnel to display in Real time:

• The expected schedule for today, set by the institution (timezones are automatically calculated)

• The attendance time today (clock in)

• The break time today

• The time spent on the current Activity/Resource

This plugin requires the Leeloo LXP Login and Attendance Tracking plugin, the Leeloo LXP Synchronizer plugin and the Leeloo LXP SSO plugin. It also requires the Leeloo LXP Activities and Resources Tracking plugin to show the time spent on the current Activity/Resource in the Activity page.
